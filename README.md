# AIHouseKeeper

## Introduction
The motivation for this project stems from the observation that smartphones are widely used as productivity tools to take quick note in people's daily lives, the conventional way of taking notes and recalling information from notes is through textual input in some productivity apps. However, they sometime may not be effective and convenient because manually inputting notes and scrolling up and down to find some certain note is troublesome, especially in a short time span. By using AI housekeeper, people can simply talk to their devices directly and let the housekeeper handle the memorization and retrieval tasks. This saves the hassle of manually entering text and manually looking for information. This may also benefit the elderly, who may have difficulties in typing notes.
Therefore, the aim of this project is to design and develop an Android application called AI housekeeper that can help people remember and retrieve important things by using natural language conversations. The housekeeper will be based on the ChatGPT model, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing system powered by the OpenAI API. The housekeeper will be able to store and retrieve information from the user's statements and answer their queries accordingly.
